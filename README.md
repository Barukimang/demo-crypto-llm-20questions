# Crypto-Enabled GPT using Vercel AI SDK, Next.js, OpenAI, and Syndicate

This example shows how to use the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [OpenAI](https://openai.com), and [Syndicate](https://docs.syndicate.io) to create a crypto-enabled GPT chat bot that can send crypto transactions. In this example, the GPT is hiding a secret word, and if the player can correctly guess it, the GPT will send the player an NFT as a prize onchain.

## Requirements

To create locally you need to:

1. Sign up for [OpenAI's developer platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and create an API KEY.
